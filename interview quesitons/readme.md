  Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that is used for the purpose of encryption. It ensures privacy, data integrity, and authentication in the network like   online transactions.<br><br>
  Following are the steps for setting up an SSL encryption: 
  - A browser connects to an SSL-secured web server. 
  - The browser requests the serverâ€™s public key in exchange for its own private key. 
  - If it is trustworthy, the browser requests to establish an encrypted connection with the web server. 
  - The web server sends the acknowledgment to start an SSL encrypted connection. 
  - SSL communication starts to take place between the browser and the web server.
